# Car-park-management-system

This application uses Thymeleaf as a frontend template to only give the opportunities to make interaction with backend.
It generated templates, but I am not focued on frontend.
3 layers application, HTTP layer, Service layer and Data Access layer.
Service layer is almost fully covered with junit and mockito tests.
I use Spring Data Jpa, Hibernate, Sql, Docker, Docker-Compose, Junit, Mockito, vanilla JavaScript, Html.
I avoid n + 1 and lazy loading enitities loading problem.
I secure databse from parallel record loading and implement Optimistic Locking to protect it.
I use transactions i JPA and relationa between entities.
